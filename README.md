*A placeholder for the retired repository.*

+ The `pe_unmapper` is now a part of the [`libPEConv` project](https://github.com/hasherezade/libpeconv/), and has been moved into the following location:
https://github.com/hasherezade/libpeconv/tree/master/pe_unmapper

+ The `imports_unerase` capabilities has been integrated into [PE-sieve](https://github.com/hasherezade/pe-sieve) and is no longer available as a separate tool. If you still need it implemented as a separate utility (as it was before) feel free to make a related issuse.
